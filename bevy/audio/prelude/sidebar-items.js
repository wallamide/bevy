It must be [`Send`] and [`Sync`], and usually implements [`Asset`] so needs to be [`TypeUuid`], in order to be registered. Types that implement this trait usually contain raw sound data that can be converted into an iterator of samples. This trait is implemented for [`AudioSource`]. Check the example `audio/decodable` for how to implement this trait on a custom type."]]};
